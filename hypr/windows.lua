-- Phase 3: Dwindle-native BSP tiling.
--
-- Removed the `maximize = true` windowrule. Dwindle handles all layout
-- natively: windows tile into a binary space partition tree. The maximize
-- action is now user-initiated via Super+Up (toggle maximize within layout).
-- Floating windows (dialogs, scratchpad, OSD) are left untouched by dwindle.

-- omarchy-switch picker: always floating, pinned, no frame, no rounded
-- corners, and it animates in (smooth even for a 4-finger swipe).
-- Positioned slightly above center (~35% from the top of the monitor):
-- center first, then shift to (50% x, 35% y) via monitor-relative move.
